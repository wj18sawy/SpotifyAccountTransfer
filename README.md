# SpotifyAccountTransfer
Messing with Spotify API to hopefully transfer Apple music info into a Spotify Account, or at least speed up the process.

There is some logic in the dev branch I've used to speed up the process of converting apple music account data to spotify. Although because of apples lack of support/open endpoints the solution was very hacky.

Keeping code here because it was still useful in helping friends create spotify accounts with their apple songs and playlists.
